# CITS3403 PROJECT - Music Recommendation and Review Board

## About

This website will be a request board where users can post music recommendations and then other users can reply with their own rating/review of the music. It would be similar to websites like [Rate Your Music](https://rateyourmusic.com/) and [Album of The Year](https://www.albumoftheyear.org/), but in the style of a user request board instead of a database that has singular pages for each album. Some potential features would be embedding music links from streaming services, having a dedicated rating element, users being able to like/dislike others posts, searching for posts, tags for artists/genres, user pages, and featured posts.
